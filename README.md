## [Dataset](https://github.com/DiwakerRathore/Life-Expectancy-WHO/blob/main/Life%20Expectancy%20Data.csv):
The dataset has been collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
## [Data Description:](https://github.com/DiwakerRathore/Life-Expectancy-WHO/raw/main/Data%20Description.xlsx)
This dataset tracks many features of a nation for a period of 15 years, from 2000 â€“ 2015 to determine which factors play the most responsible role for deciding the life expectancy of its citizens. This will help many developing nations to take steps which will allow them to tackle the most important factors that are responsible for low life expectancy. This project is trying to determine an efficient way of improving the life expectancy of many developing nations.
## Inspiration:
In this problem we're aiming to answer the following key questions:
* Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
* Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
* How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
* Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
* What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
* Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
* Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
* What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
## Techniques/ Roadmap:
### 1.	Data Exploration and Cluster Analysis (Week 1)
We will perform various Data Exploration techniques and apply some of the unsupervised learning algorithms like K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to obtain insights about the dataset.
### 2.	Data Preprocessing (Week 2)
We will be using Linear Model as the base model to finalize the data preprocessing steps. (multiple outliers removal techniques, encoding techniques, scaling/normalization techniques, feature engineering and different type of imputation combination etc.)
### 3.	Regression Techniques and Conclusion. (Week 3-5)
Building various Regression Models and perform Model Stacking (Stacking is an ensemble learning technique to combine multiple regression models via a meta-regressor) and Model Blending (Model blending is the manual step, where we manually adjust the weight for each model in order to ensemble the predictions to improve the score), comparing and selecting the best model and answering all the questions.
